# Network-Mapper

# Discovers nodes on the network using ARP Pings 


#Usage
$ sudo ./neighbourhood.py [-i <interface>]


Many network attacks come from unknown nodes on your network. It is important to know and keep track of all devices on your network to ensure security. Knowing all the devices connected to your network such as their IP and MAC and time at which they are connected will help ensure that there is no foreign node on the network. A solution to this problem would be the development of a tool that utilizes ARP pings and other Scapy functions to help uncover the identities of those connected to the network. Using this program we can utilize CORE in simulating a network environment by creating a topology involving a router, a switch, and multiple nodes. This will help produce the results needed in order to identify and ensure no foreign nodes are connected to the network. In return the tool will help provide better network security and maintain the integrity of your network  Also preventing the entry or unauthorized nodes within a network that may introduce a wide variety of potential threats.
